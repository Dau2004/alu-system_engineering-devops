Web Stack Debugging Project
Introduction
Welcome to the Web Stack Debugging project! This project is part of a series designed to train you in the art of debugging web applications. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, being able to debug a web stack is an essential skill, and this project provides you with the opportunity to practice and master it.

Project Overview
In this project, you will be given broken or bugged web stacks and your task is to debug them. Your ultimate goal is to come up with a Bash script that, when executed, will bring the web stack to a working state. However, before writing the script, you need to manually figure out what is going wrong and fix it.

Project Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of web stack debugging. You will encounter various issues such as misconfigured servers, malfunctioning services, or incorrect permissions. By troubleshooting these issues, you will gain valuable insights into how web applications work and how to diagnose and resolve problems effectively.

Tools and Resources
To assist you in debugging, you will be provided with a Docker container containing the problematic web stack. Additionally, you can use various resources such as the man pages and online documentation for the tools and services involved in the stack. Furthermore, you are encouraged to use the Shellcheck tool to ensure your Bash scripts are error-free.

Project Structure
The project is organized into directories corresponding to each task. Each directory contains the necessary files, including Bash scripts, Docker configurations, and README files. You are required to follow the project requirements, including using appropriate editors, maintaining file endings, and providing meaningful comments in your scripts.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the provided GitHub repository and navigate to the respective directory for the task you are working on. Read the task description carefully and understand the problem before attempting to debug. Use the provided Docker container to simulate the web stack environment and execute your fixes.

Conclusion
The Web Stack Debugging project offers a hands-on learning experience in diagnosing and resolving issues commonly encountered in web development. By completing the tasks and writing effective Bash scripts, you will sharpen your debugging skills and become more proficient in troubleshooting web applications.

Happy debugging!
